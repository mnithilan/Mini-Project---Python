# 21CSS101J-MINI-PROJECT
This is my mini-project for my 1st semester.
In this project I have used python and mysql to get input from the user, store it in mysql database, then change and display the result according to the requirements.
This project has the ability to store the vehicle number, driver name, type of the vehicle, amount required for parking the vehicle, time in and time out of the vehicle.
It also allows us to change the vehicle type and amount charged, change the status of the vehicle as IN or OUT, delete the vehicle details.
It also allows us to display the entire parked vehicles, to search for the details of a particular parked vehicle and to check if the vehicle is parked or not. 
This project is just the beginning and in future I am planning to add more features to it and integrate GUI in it.
